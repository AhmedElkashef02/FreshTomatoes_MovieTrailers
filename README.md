Type cd pythonpractice to change directory to your pythonpractice folder, and hit Enter.
Type python `./entertainment_center.py` to run your program!

If you have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed (Your machine comes with a version of Python 2 but you can install Python 3 as well), you should run `python3 entertainment_center.py`

Create a folder on your computer to use for your Python programs, such as `~/pythonpractice`, and **save your .py files in that folder.**
Open up the terminal program. In KDE, open the main menu and select "Run Command..." to open Konsole. In GNOME, open the main menu, open the Applications folder, open the Accessories folder, and select Terminal.
Type cd ~/pythonpractice to change directory to your pythonpractice folder, and hit Enter.
